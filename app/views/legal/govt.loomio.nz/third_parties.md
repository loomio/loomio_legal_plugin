# Third Parties

Updated 2018-07-10

This page describes which companies, services and other parties store, process or exchange data in order to provide you with either loomio.org or a private Loomio service managed by Loomio Cooperative.

We describe what data is exchanged, when and why. We also link to relevant policy documents including GDPR compliance statements and privacy policies.

## Personally Identifying data and user content
Parties listed here store, process or receive personally identifying data and user generated content on behalf of Loomio.

#### Search engines and members of the public
If your group makes content "public", the names & profile photos of participants in the content along with the content itself, will be indexed by search engines and available to the general public.

#### Members of your group
The members of your group receive your name, profile picture and any user content shared with the group. If your group is on a paid subscription, the coordinator of the group has access to the email addresses of the group members.

It's worth noting that the security of information entered into your Loomio group is dependent upon the security of the email services, personal computers and security practices of your group's members.

#### Intercom
[Intercom](https://intercom.com) is our customer support system, which we use to keep in touch with you and track support requests. They receive names and email addresses, location information, and group names and usage metadata.

If you don't want these details going to Intercom, you can install [privacy badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or something similar in your browser.
